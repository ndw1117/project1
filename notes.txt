Enter Name at start.
Load songs at start so there's no in-game delay from server.
Play game using random portion of stored song files and array of all song names for type bar. (Do I need to stream? -> Only if audio tag doesn't work with loading files)
End of game, automatically POST name and score (either adding new user of updating), then show leaderboard using GET
Maybe play again button (ideal b/c songs will still be loaded in/stored) or reload page.


Next Step:
- Keep track of played audio
- Don't play song that was already played, either use separate array of remove song from song list (and reload all audio when play again)
- When played audio length = songlist length (or songlist length == 0), game is over and you get highest score
